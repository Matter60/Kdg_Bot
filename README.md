# Kdg Bot

Kdg Bot is a Discord bot designed to fetch and display your class schedule for the current day. I made this to simplify viewing my classes that i have for the day without opening the whole site.

## Features
- !today is the command to show all your classes for today it will be shown in an embed.

## Usage
1. Create a .env file in the root directory.
2. Add the following variables to the .env file:
    
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
    ICS_URL=your_ics_file_url

3. Run the bot, and it will automatically fetch and display your schedule.
